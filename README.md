## Assignment Details

# Part Two - Tip Pool
First part of the assignment involved completing server.test.js by adding in the necessary clean up functions. 
The second part, which ate up tooooo much time, was to test the remainder of the application. There were many starts, stops, and restarts on this one. I just was not expecting the amount of object rebuilds in order to test all the functions. It was interesting to see how the code was broken up into 3 JavaScript files depending on whether it was Server-related (Waiter would have been a better term) or Payment-related functions. 


# Part One - Loan Calculator
Assignment involved creating Jasmine tests to test the calculateMonthlyPayment function. 

Please go to github repository [Tip Pool Jasmine Tests](https://github.com/JimGeist/sb_07-01-12-1_JasmineExercises-LoanCalc/) for the ReadMe with the details for the Loan Calculator test portion of this assignment.
